    <h1>Improvised Old Fashioned</h1>
    <h2>The History and Origin</h2>
    <p>Most can attest to the fact that after a long day of whichever herculean effort eduring or completed (work,
        school, children, psychotic family/ex relationships, any combination of the previously mentioned; honestly, pick
        whatever drove you to this weird, obscure, busy work exercise of an article) they merely wish to engage in their
        vice of choice.
        As it happens, alcohol coincidentally is a vice that involves bathing the brain in a chemical reaction
        while also giving one something to do with their hands. While I usually grab a beer and let the pointlessness of
        Netflix put me to sleep, sometimes there is just enough
        energy to try a little bit harder than that. </p>

    <p>I’ll preface this with the disclaimer that while I’ve stated this
        is an Old Fashioned, it is very obviously not an Old Fashioned to anyone that bothers to look one
        up, has made one, or enjoys one at whichever frequency one seeks said beverage. This recipe exists to merely
        provide some satisfaction that I
        accomplished something at the end of the day (substituting complexity of ratios for efficiency of consumption).
        Now that we’ve established history and origin, let's get to it!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheapish or Preferred Whiskey/Bouron</li>
        <li>Preferred Soda/Pop</li>
        <li>Marachino Cherries</li>
        <li>Beverage Recepticle (read steps then decide which size matters)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolutely the most important step of the process; do you prefer to taste the choice alcohol or prefer not
            to. If you have a particular bourbon or whiskey (I use a whiskey I didn't have to negotiate the purchase of
            with my wife) with notes that please the senses and such, grab a rocks glass (or a pint glass and just abuse
            the brain basket and yourself the next day).</li>

        <li>First thing that needs done to that glass is to add cherries. Have a rocks glass? Two or three should
            do fine. Pint glass or inbetween? Wish to deceive yourself into thinking this is an attempt at being
            remotely healthy? That’s a lot of space that’s getting filled.
            If adding ice go ahead and make one of the last decidsions that you can make with full faculties
            prior to consumption. </li>

        <li>Next add alcohol based on taste preferences (or how abhorrent the day was) and then add soda/pop that
            happens to also be in a fridge. My current sugar infused carbonated vice is Dr. Pepper.</li>

        <li>This final step is a two fold process. Figure out what your doing with yourself while you imbibing and enjoy
            this odd and lazy concoction. Remeber! Make good decisions (disclaimer: being that this drink is sugar and
            dark liquor that's a violent hangover you're potentailly setting yourself up for. Make good decidsions so
            "future you" isn't pissed with "past you" the next day.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Favorite Take</h2>
    <p>As of writing this, my go to for the improvised old fashioned is rooted in ease of consumption. I use (read
        previously had) Tin Cup Whiskey and Dr. Pepper. After finding a mostly clean 10 oz.
        rocks glass I’ll pour a few fingers (twoish inches) of whiskey in a glass. Add said pop until I have about an
        inch or so of space left on the top of the glass. Toss in a few cherries and proceed to unplug my brain via
        Netflix or whichever story driven game I happen to be invested in at the time while repeating as needed.
